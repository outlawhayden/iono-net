This folder contains mostly utilities for checking outputs, examining model accuracy, and verifying algorithmic correctness. 

Inside sar_objects, the most important scripts are the evaluate_system scripts, which load weights generated by training a model in the 'model' directory (saved as a .pkl) file, a random sample from the dataset defined in the matching config file, and do some forward passes to examine the output quality, etc.,
Note - for this to work, the architecture (size and shape) of the model loaded has to match the setup used to train the model that has its weights stored in the .pkl, otherwise it will throw an error. 
    evaluate_system_pytorch and evaluate_system_ynet are the most recent ones I built in PyTorch - the other ones in 'archived' are built on the older JAX framework. I didn't delete them as they might be useful references, but they had bugs in them, ultimately a lot of them why I changed over to PyTorch
